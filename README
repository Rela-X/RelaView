Instructions:
To build RelaView from the sources you have to install the Qt SDK or the Qt Library. For more information: http://qt.nokia.com/
RelaView dynamically links to an unmodified Qt Library

Build:
1) run "qmake" in the folder which includes the BuildAll.pro file
2) run make

In RelaView/build/release or RelaView/build/debug you can find the application

Standard build mode: debug mode
If you wish to build RelaView in release mode use:

1) qmake -r "CONFIG-=debug" 
2) make


Mac OSX:
If you are using osx qmake generates a xcode project file. It is recommended to generate a Makefile instead. Therefore add: 

-spec macx-g++

to qmake (e.g. qmake -r "CONFIG-=debug" -spec macx-g++).


replace Dynamic Libs:
If you want to replace the dynamic Qt libraries of an OSX App Bundle, you have to dive into the package: "RelaView.app/Contents/Frameworks/" and replace the packages. You can also delete all Qt* folders in the Framework folder and run macdeployqt (part of the Qt SDK) again, to replace the dynamic libs.
